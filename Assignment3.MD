## Question 1
*Generate problem statements that focus on the function to be achieved by any viable design solution:*

### Problem:
The Average number of wildfires each year in the United States is close to 70,000. These wildfires devestate large areas of land causing enviromental harm and property damage. With the effects of climate change, wildfires are becoming increasingly common and more devestating.

### Backround: 
Wildfire devestation came into mainstream news with The great Fire in 1910, which devestated over Three million acres of land. Since Then, increases in air polloution, long seasons of drought, and signiffigant deofrestation have alll contributed to the increased number of wildfires affecting the United States. This has resulted in an urgent need to monitor and control these wildfires as well as prevent them before they become a natural disaster, 

### Relevance: 
Impacts of Climate Change are starting to be realised across the globe. In an effort to combat these issues, we need to act fast. By creating a system to monitor and prevent these fires from occuring, we can save thousands of acres of remote wilderness leaving more natural resources to combat air polloution. 

### Objecvtive:
Reduce the Number of acres that burn each year due to wildfires:

## Question 2
*Apply a number of techniques and strategies such as the statement-restatement technique, the source/cause approach, the revision method, present state-desired state (PS-DS) strategy, and Duncker diagrams*

### Statment/ Restatment Technique:

#### Original Statment:
  *Wildfires are having a devestating effect on our enviroment.*

#### Restatments:
1. *Wildfires are having a devestating effect on the natural enviroment of our nations forests, contributing to climate change.*
2. *Wildfires are destroying much of our natural landscape as well as personal property due to the effects of climate change.*
3. *Wildfires are destroying our nation's forests and our communities as a result of increasing temepratures and drought conditions.*

### The Source/Cause Approach:

#### Sources for data gathering: 
 * Source on Wildfire and Climate Connections [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.noaa.gov/noaa-wildfire/wildfire-climate-connection#:~:text=Research%20shows%20that%20changes%20in,fuels%20during%20the%20fire%20season.)
 * Source on Impact of Human-Caused wildfires: [Science.org](https://www.science.org/content/article/human-sparked-wildfires-are-more-destructive-those-caused-nature)
 * Research Paper on Enviromental Servcies and Landscape Ecology As It relates to Wildfires [Springer Link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-019-00832-9)


### Present State/Desired State

#### Present State:
On average, it can take wildland fire fighters up to 3 days to recognize and respond to a Wild fire in a remote wilderness area. This delay can allow the fire to spread un-controlled, destroying much of the ecosystem and even present a danger to human lives. 

#### Desired State: 
Ultimately, determing the enviromental metrics of a remote area (Temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind conditions, soil conditions, etc.) could suggest when and where a fire is likley to happen. This data could be used by ecologists and meterologists to monitor these conditions more closley and deploy resources where needed before a disaster happens. Wildland Firefighters could use generation old techniques such as controlled burns and back burning to prevent larger fires and even rehabilitate areas with poor enviromental conditions.

## Question 3:
*Perform Kepner-Tregoe (KT) situation analysis to evaluate various aspects of a situation in terms of three criteria (timing, trend, and impact), thereby determining what is known, which tasks should be performed, and in what order these tasks should be completed*

### What is Known: 
 * An increase in the number of Wildfires is linked to Climate Change, Drought, and De-forestation. 
 * In order to prevent the devestating effects of these fires, we need to determine when and where they are likely to happen. 

### What should be done: 
 * Monitoring of remote areas, most likley to experience a fire, needs to be improved. 
 * Actions to reduce the effects of climate change and reduce our impact on the enviroment need to continue to be taken.
 * Increased awareness of Human-caused wildfires and their impact needs to be taught to the public.

### Timeline of Monitoring station development:
1. Secure funding to purchase equipment to build a protoype monitoring station. 
2. Develop software to monitor enviromental conditions.
3. Partner with a satalite communications company to relay the data. 
4. Develop a database and interface to monitor data from the sensors. 
5. Create a power system to allow the sensors to be deployed remotely. 
6. Test the sesnors and prove reliablity, and effectivness. 
7. Finalize and revise design. 
8. Secure funding to build sensors and deploy.
9. Monitor enviromental conditions.

##Question 4:
*Perform KT problem analysis to determine possible causes of a problem*

### Possible Causes for the Increase in Wildfires:
1. Human Casused wildfires are more prevelant. 
2. Deforestation and uncontrolled land use. 
3. Suburbanization destroying much of the natural landscape. 
4. Clime Change increasing global temperatures and prolonging the fire season.
5. Invasive spescies taking over and killing native envirments leaving fuel for fires. 
6. Drought Conditions caused by Climatechange.
